 * @title OriginFeeSplitter
 * @notice One per token. Receives the swap fee in native ETH from the
 *         OriginFeeHook and splits it among creator, platform, kas and airdrop
 *         (of every 150 bps: creator 100, platform 20, kas 20, airdrop 10).
 *         distribute() is permissionless.
 *
 *         The creator chooses how THEIR share is delivered (feeReceiveType):
 *           0 = ETH only   (native ETH, default)
 *           1 = TOKEN only (buy back the token with the ETH, send token)
 *           2 = BOTH       (half ETH, half bought-back token)
 *         Platform/kas/airdrop are always paid in ETH (the airdrop share must
 *         stay ETH for the vault / stream-2). Token buyback routes through the
 *         OriginSwapRouter; if it ever fails the creator is paid in ETH instead,
 *         so distribute() can never brick.
