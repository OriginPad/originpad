/**
 * @title OriginFeeHook
 * @notice Shared Uniswap V4 hook that charges a 1.5% fee on every swap and pays
 *         it out in native ETH. Pools are native-ETH / TOKEN (currency0 = ETH).
 *         - Buy  (ETH -> TOKEN): fee taken from the input ETH in beforeSwap.
 *         - Sell (TOKEN -> ETH): fee taken from the output ETH in afterSwap.
 *         The token has no transfer tax, so buys and sells both work on V4, and
 *         the fee always lands as ETH (no token-to-ETH conversion needed).
 * @dev Deployed once and shared. Its address must be CREATE2 mined so the low
 *      bits encode beforeSwap (0x80) + afterSwap (0x40) + beforeSwapReturnDelta
 *      (0x08) + afterSwapReturnDelta (0x04) = 0xCC. Only exact-input swaps are
 *      charged; the app always swaps exact-input.
